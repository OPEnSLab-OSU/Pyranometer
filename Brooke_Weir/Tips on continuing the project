About the code:
  * Most of the sensors are I2C so if you want to integrate another sensor using the same method as we did, it would be best to find other I2C sensors. 
  * The files we added are loom_tmp007.h, loom_veml6075.h, loom_si1145.h along with changes to library.ino and config.h.
  * If you are getting an error with the libraries not being properly included, check that header files are in each folder and not in another folder within that folder.
  
About the materials:
  * The square glass sheet doesn't allow IR to pass through, while the acryclic domes doesn't allow UV to pass through.
  * The general equation we used to write the code in loom_tmp007.h is the Stefan-Bolzmann Law (http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/stefan.html).

About the accuracy of the data:
  * The data from the tmp007 is not accurate. It mostly stays constant at 400 W/m^2. 
  * The data from the tsl2591 follows closely the data from the apogee, but the W/m^2 is much lower than what it should be. It probably needs to just be calibrated to make more sense.
  
About the lab:
  * OPEnS lab employs helpful staff members so use them as a resource.
