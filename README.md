# Senior-Project-Group3-Pyranometer
Senior Project featuring the OPEnS Pyranometer radiation sensor.

The Setup_Instructions_For_Grading file contains step by step instructions on what to gather and how to upload the code for this project. The Assembly_Instructions file has more in depth information on necessary materials and 3D printing instructions. In that file, the cost of each material is displayed as well as containing some basic flashing instructions.


The LOOM folder holds the code (using OPEnS lab LOOM 1 architecture) for the pyranometer. The node measures and reports data, while the hub is a receiver for loom and uploads data via PushingBox. The CAD folder contains files to make the 3D design. There are also folders containing documents for the Fall and Spring terms of the senior capstone class. There is also a file of informal tips for picking up the project.
